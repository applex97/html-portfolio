    <!--
    *Since the spririted away file is in the same location as the 2.4 movie 
    ranking project folder, I can just use the tag <img src=""> and put the name of the file and the webp for it to appear
    *Also, in order to change the width and height to fit the webpage, I can play around with the width and height
    scaling.
    *Start with 300 to 500-->
